# Teneo

> Teneo is a News and Wiki Decentralized Application.

### Project Description

The Goal of the project is to use RSS3 to gather data from the Web3 ecosystem and serve as a platform were users can browse, search and read articles, edit, and vote informative content that can be verified and audited. By utilizing the high-integrity aspect of Blockchain, we can potentially mitigate the risks of misinformation and fake news.

### Getting Started

> The project frontend is built using NextJS
> First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
